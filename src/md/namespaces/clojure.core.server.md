clojure.core.server contains functions to expose the Clojure environment through a socket connection and across network boundaries. If the property `-Dclojure.server.repl="{:port 8881 :accept clojure.core.server/repl}"` is present when the JDK starts, Clojure will start the related socket server (or more than one) on the specified port. The API in the namespace allows to do this programmatically.
